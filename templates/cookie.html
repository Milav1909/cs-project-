                        <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
                        <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, AAVA DE!) are called "first-party cookies".

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Performance Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.</li>
                            <li><strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages.</li>
                            <li><strong>Targeting Cookies:</strong> These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites.</li>

                        <ul>

                            <li>To help us understand how visitors interact with our website</li>
                            <li>To compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions</li>

                        <p>In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-party cookies to report usage statistics of the Service, deliver advertisements on and through the Service, and so on. These may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Analytics providers</strong> such as Google Analytics</li>

                        <h2>6. Your Cookie Choices</h2>
                        <p>Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you.</p>
                        <p>You can also opt-out of targeted advertising by using the following links:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Digital Advertising Alliance</li>
                            <li>Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada</li>
                            <li>European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Currently, we do not respond to "Do Not Track" signals.</p>
